      <h3>Something I like to do for fun</h3>
      <p>I have played music for a while and I like to make arrangements on the clarinet. I have posted some videos on my youtube channel but I have slowed down while in College. I aim to restart once I graduate and have more time.</p>

      <h3>My favorite foods</h3>
      <p>My all time favorite food is Pho, I can't ever get tired of it and it always hits the spot. I also enjoy sushi, especially Chirashi bowls. I always am in the mood for korean food and one of my favorites is black goat stew or 흑염소 전골.</p>
